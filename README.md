# Mixup
Simple library of any mixins found or built that come in handy on a regular basis.

Mixup can be added to any project giving you sassy super powers :)

Simply clone this down into your sass directory and `@import "";` to the `mixup.scss` partial.

Mixup is an ever-evolving project and therefore is in no way complete.
